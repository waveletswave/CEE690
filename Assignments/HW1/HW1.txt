0. Make a Github repository for the course 
1. Install miniconda and create your own environment that has numba, rasterio, matplotlib, scikit-learn. Save the environment configuration to a .yml file and submit that file. 
2. Create and upload a custom vimrc. It needs to have 5 features that you added to it. Add comments in the vimrc describe those unique features.
3. Create and upload a custom bashrc. It needs to have 5 features that you added to it. Add comments in the bashrc describe those unique features.
4. Ensure that your code is following a style guide (e.g., PEP-8). 
5. Your code must have the possibility of using either command line arguments and/or a text/json/xml file as input. 
6. Write at least 20 unit tests for your project.
7. Ensure you have a Readme and sphinx documentation for your project.
8. Enable GitHub automation for your project.
9. Ensure your code is "ready for pip".
10. Create some nested for loops and use Numba and enable shared parallelism. The number of threads use should be specified as a software input parameter.
11. Use functions and classes throughout your project. Avoid spaghetti code practices at all cost. 
12. Make sure the code is ready to go. I will install and run a test of it on the DCC.
