# CEE690: Software Engineering for Spatial Data Analysis
## Spring 2026

## Course Information
Lectures are on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:15 AM - 11:30 AM. The course website is on GitHub (https://github.com/chaneyn/CEE690). Class announcements will be made via Canvas (CEE 690.01.Sp26).

### Instructor
Professor Nathaniel W. Chaney (Nate)  
Email: nathaniel.chaney@duke.edu  
Office: FCIEMAS 2463  
Office hours: TBD

## Course Description
This course will equip students to build and deploy high-performance simulation tools for large-scale environmental challenges. The topics that will be covered include high performance computing, scripting at the terminal, text editors, building modular code, compiled and scripted languages, profiling, unit-testing, documentation, and parallelism via OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA. Other topics will include briding high-level Python logic with low-level hardware.

## Prerequisites
CEE 506: Environmental Spatial Data Analysis is a prerequisite. If you have not taken CEE 506, please contact Nate to determine if this course is appropriate for you.

## Readings
There are no required textbooks.

## Grades and workload
The course grade will be based on:
* Homework: 20%
* Project I: 40%
* Project II: 40%

### Homework
* There will be two homeworks; each one will be due at the same time as each project.

### Schedule
Note that the schedule is subject to change (and will change).
